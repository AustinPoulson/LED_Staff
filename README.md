# LED_Staff
This is the code I wrote for my custom built LED staff. The code is running on an Arduino Trinket using Neopixels (WS2812B).

Documentation:

To use this project, you need to either change the code to work with your project, or message me for the schematics and follow them.

The idea in this project is to run my custom built led staff while also developing a framework to make it easier to build led patterns.
